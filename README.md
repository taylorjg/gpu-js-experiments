# Description

I created a little Mastermind web app (see [here](https://github.com/taylorjg/Mastermind)) including an auto-solve mode which is an implementation of 
[this algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Five-guess_algorithm). I used [Hamsters.js](https://www.hamsters.io/) to try to speed up the algorithm. The idea of this repo is to experiment with [gpu.js]((http://gpu.rocks/)) with a view to speeding up the Mastermind solving algorithm even further.
