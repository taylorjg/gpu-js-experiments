# Description

I created a Mastermind web app using Vue.js (code repo [here](https://github.com/taylorjg/mastermind-svg-vue) and play it live [here](https://mastermind-svg-vue.herokuapp.com/)) including an [autosolve](https://mastermind-svg-vue.herokuapp.com?autosolve) mode which is an implementation of 
[Donald Knuth's Five-guess algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Worst_case:_Five-guess_algorithm). I used [Hamsters.js](https://gitlab.com/hordesolutions/Hamsters.js) to try to speed up the algorithm. The idea of this repo is to experiment with [gpu.js](http://gpu.rocks/) with a view to speeding up the implementation of the algorithm even further.
